# ApiGuardian Registration

Registration can be handled in a number of ways. The gist of it is that each
registration strategy has different required fields, but you will always pass in
a `type` attribute to specify the strategy you want to use. If registration
succeeds, the user record will be returned.

Endpoint: POST `{engine_mount_path}/register`

## Configuration

ApiGuardian has a hook available after a registration takes place. This allows you to do something like send a welcome email, or perhaps subscribe the user to a mailing list, or maybe send a Slack notification. No matter which registration stategy is used, this block will be executed.

```rb
ApiGuardian.configure do |config|
  # ...

  # Often, applications will want to send emails or do other things specific to
  # registration. You can use this block to hook into what happens after a user is
  # registered.
  config.after_user_registered = lambda do |user|
    MyMailer.welcome(user).deliver_later
  end

  # ...
end
```

## Email

To register a user via email, the following fields are required.

```js
{
  "type": "email",
  "email": "person@example.com",
  "password": "somepassword",
  "password_confirmation": "somepassword"
}
```

## Third-Party Registration

Each third-party registration strategy makes use of a handful of fields to provide
the proper data for creating a user. *Note: Password can be optionally provided so
that the user can also sign in via email on return trips. If it is not provided
then a strong, random password will be generated for them*
