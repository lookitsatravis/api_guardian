  # The Client Password Reset URL is used in the email sent when resetting
  # a user's password. The client should post the token provided along with the
  # users's new password to /complete-reset-password. This is done because this

  # another server or system providing an implementation of password grant oauth.
  # The delegation_url will provide a light weight single
  # sign on solution with a central authentication authority.  The default for
  # this config item is an empty string.
