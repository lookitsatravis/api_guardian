Special thanks to [Anton Visser](https://github.com/toneplex) for his work and support on this project.

## Overview

ApiGuardian includes the following features out of the box:

* User registration (email/pass)
* Stateless authentication using OAuth2 (via [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) and [Doorkeeper::JWT](https://github.com/chriswarren/doorkeeper-jwt))
* Roles and Permissions
* Password reset workflow
* Guest access
* Policy enforcement (via [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit))
* Serialization to [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) (via [fast_jsonapi](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi))
* Two-factor support
* Extensable to support any auth or registration strategies

What doesn't it include?

* Stateful session support (Cookies)
* HTML/CSS/JS or views of any kind.

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 2.5
* PostgreSQL >= 9.3 (JSON and uuid-ossp support)
* Rails >= 6.0

**Note: For now, your app must use a PostgreSQL database.** This is because ApiGuardian is using UUID primary keys for all records.

## Quick Start

### First

Put this in your Gemfile:

```rb
# Include ApiGuardian from edge
gem 'api_guardian', git: 'https://github.com/lookitsatravis/api_guardian'
```

### Next

Run the following command. It will:

* Add an initializer
* Mount ApiGuardian in your routes file
* Copy migration files
* Add seed data

```sh
rails generate api_guardian:install
```

You will need to follow this with:

```sh
rake db:migrate
```

Take a moment here to review your seed file and make any changes. And then:

```sh
rake db:seed
```

### Finally

Make all of your API controllers extend `ApiGuardian::ApiController` and your
policies extend `ApiGuardian::Policies::ApplicationPolicy`. What is a policy, you ask,
and why should you care? Well, [I'm glad you asked](docs/authorization/readme.md)!

See our [Documentation](docs/readme.md) for way more information on setup and usage,
or take a look at the RDoc formatted docs here:
